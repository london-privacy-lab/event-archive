# Event Archive

Privacy Lab was started by Mozilla in the USA. The intention is to build an grassroots network of academia, professionals, businesses, developers, activists, and interested members of the public. Events are usually developed by volunteers, often taking the form of panel discussions and project presentations.

The very first London Privacy Lab was in July 2016. Local Mozillians attended this event and expressed interest in taking the event to a more regular timescale. Subsequent meetups have been at Mozilla London, but in keeping with Mozilla's initiatives to encourage decentralisation, activate and grow local community engagement, and work in the open, it's our intention to further establish and grow the scope of London Privacy Lab.

What this means to us is that we intend holding semi-regular workshops and events - where interested community members already engage. At universities, legal & privacy professionals, developer and co-working spaces, charity and non-profits, open source product businesses, and all interested parties aligned with the Mozilla Mission. 

It's the London Privacy Lab team's intention of emphasising the grassroots nature of these events and through content variety, workshops, tutorials, open discourse, and remote interaction, as our focus.

In no way is this list intended to be restrictive. We welcome contribution from anyone interested in talking about the importance of Privacy. Not just minority groups and journalism, but fields of sience, design, education and more!

Privacy is not only an indelible human right, but it is something worth fighting for, and publicising in an array of new and engaging ways.
