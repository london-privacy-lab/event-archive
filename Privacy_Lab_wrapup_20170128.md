Last week I* organised another London Privacy Lab. This time kindly hosted by Mozilla in their London Office.

It might be a Mozilla initiative but consider them firestarters. They get some slack from the wider community for discontinuing products. The first thing I usually set the straight with is that they are a non-profit. The second is that it was open source.

Some of the main players discontinue products all the time. Never to be seen again. And they get acceptance. It comes with the territory in the business to customer (B2C) world. With Mozilla however, people come because of their passion and the Mozilla mission. This leaves deeply connected. A sense that Mozilla is different from the traditional. The open source products the release of course remain open for use long afterwards.

Mozilla is split in two. The lesser known Mozilla Foundation (known affectionately acronymous as MoFo) is actually the umbrella body. The Mozilla Corporation (MoCo), is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation. It's the Foundation that draws me to not only volunteer for them, but also make a regular small donation. This part of the organisation is much less product focus. After years in retail I find it a calming relief.

The Mozilla Foundation are all about 3 areas of focus: Shape the Agenda, Connect Leaders, Rally Citizens. Privacy and Security, Open Innovation, Decentralisation, Web Literacy, and Digital Inclusion, all fall under this 'Shape the Agenda'. Under their Foundation legal status I've been told they can not get involved in politics. Policy shaping good. Politics engagement bad.

In creating Privacy Lab they are not simply focusing on 'Privacy'. It's also Connecting Leaders, and Rallying Citizens. I am growing through the process of delivering this series of events. Through the support of the Foundation's 'Open Leadership Training' I learned the basics involved, earned trust, even failed a little. It's probably clear I'm stepping up as a community leader. Just a little teeny community right now but I'm not afraid to take risks, learn the ropes, grow, and actively take part in that whole Connecting Leaders shindig.

I'm going to write more transparently about the processes I've taken to get here. But I'll leave that for next time. Put it this way, I've felt anything but isolated. That alone will surprise many Mozillians. I saw a few even moaned about the official statement recently from Mozilla, regarding the Trump immigration policy. As a Foundation restricted on how they can engage in politics you start to appreciate the complexities involved.

Here's what went down at London Privacy Lab, 28th January 2017. We saw some slides. And we went home.

Kidding. Well we did do those things but the rest is not exactly redacted. We streamed it live to the freaking world because it was International Privacy Day. I didn't know it was a Saturday when I initially planned it so I those who may have assisted in getting it OK'd deserve my humble thanks. Events like this never just magic themselves together. It takes several people. And because I decided to live stream, this number expanded somewhat quickly.

The previous Privacy Lab's in London were organised via the Mozilla Policy Team. Consider it a product launch if you will. I hosted the panel in October as a handover. This event was the beginning of an arms reach. Me as a community member taking their effort into the wild. Scary, though not as scary as some of the subject we had on the agenda.

First up we had Gosia Rybakowska (pron. GO-shya). Gosia is a researcher TBD I say this every time I speak about her. I learn something every moment we meet. Gosia's research recently took her down the path of sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT). There was a time when we had massive computers that connected to massive computers. Then smaller computers to really big computers. Then small to small. Then mobile to big. Then something happened. In an area known as 'Machine to Machine' (M2M) the 'Machines' got so damned tiny that you can no longer really call them a computer. Then the 'Machine' companies (and their underlying standards, architectures, and electronics) diversified into new areas of business. Things.

Things where everything can connect. To a mobile. To a central computer. To a bank of computers in the cloud. To a satellite in space. Cool right? No, chill out. Privacy Lab is here to freak you out this month. Computers have bugs. When they have bugs they get updated. Problem fixed. With things, however, they might rarely get an update (if ever). Someone could hijack the radio transmission from the thing and read what was transmitted. Connected Homes, whilst sound cool, could quickly fail. Many of the platforms are not open, and proprietary. We have to sometimes trust things will work in this world. How much do you trust that thing that has not been updated in a year? Do you even know what country is comes from?

Next up Lukas Olejnik. TBD

The penultimate guest was Eva Blum-Dumontet. I'd just read her paper on tracking dissent in Thailand so fully appreciated learning some more of her activism research.

Last was Vasilios Mavroudis TBD now this talk I initially didn't event grasp. Think of the old dial-up internet days.. You'd here the data streaming through your modem as a sound. Sound comes in shapes. Ergo data also has shapes. Get into the middle of a connection (Man in the middle [MITM] attack) and the attacker could read what you're reading and typing. But 'haha, I'm not silly' you say, 'that's why we have end to end encrypted HTTPS and tools like TOR'. Now this is the terrifying bit. Brace yourselves. Even a fully encrypted connection makes those shapes. Each website or app page will make a different shape. Each picture, every file, each word. Get enough data then the attacker can surmise which pages you were looking at. I'm simplifying greatly here of course, but that's the jist of it.
